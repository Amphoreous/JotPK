## Game Description
Journey of the Prairie King is an intense arcade-style twin-stick shooter set in the untamed Wild West.

As they move through a series of increasingly difficult rooms, they'll face off against relentless monsters, getting coins, upgrades of their equipment, and power-ups that will help them continue their journey.
