## History

Journey of the Prairie King was originally a beloved minigame in Stardew Valley, celebrated for its challenging twin-stick gameplay and nostalgic arcade charm.  
Amphoreous is now undertaking the exciting task of recreating this classic game using the Raylib game engine in C. Our goal is to modernize the experience while preserving the retro essence that made the original so memorable. By leveraging Raylib's simplicity and power, we’re crafting a streamlined, high-performance version that can run on multiple platforms.
